# Restaurant-Management-System
Introduction

There are so many day-to-day processes that restaurants have to deal with. These can range from scheduling its employees, managing HR, monitoring employee attendance to preparing for payroll and to keep record of transactions and database. In current marketplace, there is a great value for food, restaurants and its management. There is day by day increment on the number of restaurants and food places that are emerging today. It can be considered as a rapid growth in the field of business and food restaurants and its management system. The management system applied for every restaurant is different from the other one. Some restaurants may be bigger while the other may be smaller but every restaurant or hotel requires a management system and this is termed as Restaurant Management System.

     Problems which might be seen as reducing the restaurants efficiency, they are the following:
     The lack of communication that is caused by handwriting.
     Uncontrolled order logging (poor order taking).
     Unproductive communication between restaurant and kitchen.
     Faults with order taking and lack of time management.
     Lack of good quality stock management.

The main purpose is to improve the performance of the restaurant by eradicating the daily             paperwork. With this system the tasks would be performed in less amount of time and more    efficiently. An additional benefit of this software is that during the rush hours the load can be balanced effectively, and restaurants would perform better than usual. In addition to this, human error that occurs when performing tasks manually is also minimized and presence of queues in the system to assign tasks to chefs can reduce congestion in the kitchen. The system would also result in reduction of labor which would result in the reduction of expenses of the restaurant.

	To make database storage for each division.
	To provide facilities of view, modify, add and delete operations under each division.
	To build an application (GUI) for Restaurant Management System and maximize restaurants profit by increasing efficiency.
